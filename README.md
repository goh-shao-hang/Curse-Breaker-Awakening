Play the demo here: https://gamecells.itch.io/curse-breaker-awakening 

Key Features:
1. Movement-based Combat: Move, jump and wall run to navigate through the levels!

2. Procedurally Generated Levels: No two runs are the same: be prepared for anything, use anything resources you can lay your hands on!

3. Sophisticated Guard-based Combat System: Attack to damage your enemies or break their guard. Guard-broken enemies can be grabbed and thrown at other enemies or into hazards! Throw props or guard broken enemies, use everything in the level to survive!

4. Challenging Boss Fights: Fight the witches guarding the portals to the upper floors, but do not forget that they are the masters of their arts...
